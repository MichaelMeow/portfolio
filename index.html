          <h3><em><strong>my story</strong></em></h3>
          <p>I've explored the world of art and design, from an architecture and mulitmedia design education to animation and writing science fiction novels.  My travels have brought me to the rich frontier of web development where my passion for lifelong learning allows me to succeed.</p>
          <p>I live in Portland, Oregon with my wife <a id="momo" href="https://www.instagram.com/slippypeach/">Momo</a>.  I practice collaborative art with her as my partner, and we succeed together.  This collaborative spirit is at the center of my creation process, and I practice it in all my work.  Working creatively in a team is what gives me joy.</p>

<!-- Here I am going to explain in a comment that I did not include an Orderered List.  I understand how to do it-it is similar to the unordored list, but uses <ol> instead of <ul>.  I have chosen not to include it because I do not feel that it fits the "polished, portfolio quality" objective to my standards. -->
