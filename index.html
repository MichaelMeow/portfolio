    <!-- Here I am going to explain in a comment that I did not include an Orderered List.  I understand how to do it-it is similar to the unordored list, but uses <ol> instead of <ul>.  I have chosen not to include it because I do not feel that it fits the "polished, portfolio quality" objective to my standards. -->
